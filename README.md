# Portfolio of Work

The scripts contained here are examples work I either wrote myself or contributed on.

+ erasetapes.sh - a simple script to wipe the MAM data off of backup tapes to make them available for re-use.
+ mongobr.sh - a wrapper around native MongoDump and MongoRestore for support staff.
+ ansible - sample of basic roles for prod, build, and devops servers
  + common - install the latest yum updates and make sure vmtoolsd is running
  + git - install git from IUS as it is much newer than the version from CentOS
+ joinAD.py - script to join Active Directory and update config files.  I wrote the first iteration of this.  It has since been improved by other members of the team.
+ sssd_to_winbind.sh - script to migrate customers using SSSD to Winbind for NTLM Auth Support
