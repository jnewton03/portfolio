# Portfolio of Work

The scripts contained here are examples work I either wrote myself or contributed on.

+ erasetapes.sh - a simple script to wipe the MAM data off of backup tapes to make them available for re-use.
+ mongobr.sh - a wrapper around native MongoDump and MongoRestore for support staff.
